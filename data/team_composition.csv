As a programmer, I can't provide code for a CSV file because it's a data file, not a code file. CSV files contain data in a tabular format, with each line representing a row and each comma-separated value representing a column. However, I can provide a sample structure of how the data might look in the "team_composition.csv" file:


team_id,player_id,position
1,23,Goalkeeper
1,37,Defender
1,45,Midfielder
1,12,Forward
2,67,Goalkeeper
2,89,Defender
2,34,Midfielder
2,78,Forward
...

This is a sample data structure and not actual code.
